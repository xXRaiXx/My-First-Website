# To-Do List

## General

- Remove all `<br>` tags! Never use the `<br>` tag EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
- Create a "Footer" that is displayed on the bottom of every page. This should include the copyright symboal using the correct ASCII code, and NOT just copy and pasting the copyright symbol.
- Create a "Navigation Bar" under the header but above the rest of the page content
- Create an "About Us" page with "Lorem Ipsum" text. Fun Note: Look up "Bacon Ipsum".
- Create a "Contact Us" form

## Index

- Center Your Header & Subheader
- Add Third Link to "Cards"
- Make Card Title Font Smaller (Small enough to have no text-wrapping)
- Prices should smaller then the title, and have a "muted" text class (Find the right class under the typography documentation)
- Card images look better if "magnified" and in the center of the card. Center the image horizontally inside of the card.

## Payment Form

- Input fields should all be required
